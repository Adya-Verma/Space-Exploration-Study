# Space Exploration Data Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores space mission data from 1957 onwards. The analysis focuses on trends, success rates, and key insights related to space exploration. The project was created as a learning exercise in data science, using Python and popular data analysis libraries.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle and provides historical data on space missions. It can be accessed here: [All Space Missions from 1957](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/agirlcoding/all-space-missions-from-1957). The dataset includes:
- Launch dates
- Mission success rates
- Launch locations
- Space agencies involved
- Costs and budgets

## Features
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations of mission trends
- Insights on successful vs. failed launches

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Reference
This project was inspired by the Kaggle notebook: [Space Mission from 1957 Data Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/code/volkanaydar/space-mission-from-1957-data-analysis-final) by Volkan Aydar.
